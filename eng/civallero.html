<p>
I'm a librarian, an archival researcher, and a trained musician who treats instruments as documents and sound as a form of knowledge transmission and semantic architecture. My work cuts across memory systems — libraries, archives, museums, and landscapes — to trace how musical instruments and sonic artifacts encode, carry, and sometimes erase histories.</p>
<p>
I studied music formally and have recorded, performed, and built instruments for decades. But my practice is not about virtuosity — it's about epistemic excavation. I hold a degree in Librarianship and Documentation, a master's in Historical Archiving and Memory, a specialization in Southern Epistemologies, and an ongoing PhD in Knowledge Management. I also have academic backgrounds in biology and history. Before all that, I was a graphic designer, radio host, editor, writer, and visual artist — all of which still bleed into my musical work.</p>
<p>
My main research platform is <i>Instrumentarium</i>. Here, instruments are approached as documentary objects: material artifacts that encode, preserve, and transmit information, and whose trajectories are shaped by cataloguing practices, archival silences, museum collection histories, and processes of loss and extinction. <i>Instrumentarium</i> includes articles, blogs, and podcasts, and also a series of digital books produced through my independent imprint <i>El Zorro de Abajo Editora</i>.</p>
<p>
On the creative side, <i>estudioparamuno</i> channels this research into a living sound laboratory based in a small village in the Colombian high Andean forest. There, I work with ecosystems as active producers of sound, and with natural materials — from clay, bark, and sap to ash, bone, and hair — as structural and acoustic components for instrument-making. This is not metaphorical work: it is experimental lutherie grounded in ecological processes, material memory, and the epistemology of matter.</p>
<p>
As a musician, I do not operate within conservatory-based performance circuits. Instead, my practice centers on the experimental reconstruction, demonstration, and analysis of instruments and their associated documents — journals, photographs, recordings — especially those housed in libraries, archives, and museum collections I also explore ecological and biological elements and processes as sound artifacts. My performances take the form of demonstrative sessions that weave sound, construction, and interpretation into a single storytelling-musical experience, making explicit both what can be known from documentary sources and what remains irretrievable.</p>
<p>
This hybrid position allows me to work across libraries, archives, museums, universities, and cultural institutions, producing concerts, exhibitions, lectures, workshops, publications, recordings, and educational activities that treat music as a form of archival inquiry and sound as a mode of knowledge production rather than as a purely virtuosic end.</p>
