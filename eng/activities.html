The activities developed within <i>Instrumentarium</i> are an educational and disseminative extension of the project's research and documentation work. They are grouped under the long-standing title <i>Sonidos de una tierra sin tiempo</i> ("Sounds of a Land Without Time"), a framework I have kept since the project's earliest stages as a way to connect scholarship, archives, and listening practices in public contexts. These activities draw on documents from libraries, archives, museums, and oral communities, and translate that material into situations where instruments, sound fragments, texts, and other supports can be experienced, discussed, and remembered.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>
<i>Sonidos de una tierra sin tiempo</i> includes educational concerts and exhibitions, conferences, courses, workshops, and seminars. Depending on context and audience, each activity can emphasize organology, musical cultures, territories and environments, or the documentation and management of oral and sound tradition.</p>

<h2 id="concerts">Educational Concerts and Exhibitions</h2>
<hr />
<p>
Educational concerts and exhibitions cover a wide range of topics related to traditional musical instruments from around the world: from the presentation of instrument families (aerophones, chordophones, membranophones) to descriptions by geographical regions / countries, ethnic groups, musical genres, or historical periods. In practice, these formats treat instruments and sound fragments as documentary artifacts: not only to be performed, but also to be read, contextualized, and remembered. All concerts include the exhibition and demonstration of instruments, fragments of oral tradition, and content based on solid academic sources and the author's research.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Examples (South America-focused):</i></b> Indigenous instruments from the highlands / lowlands of South America | Mestizo instruments from South America | Andean instruments | Traditional wind / string / percussion instruments from South America | South American panpipes / recorders / whistles | South American transverse / globular flutes | South American natural trumpets | South American clarinets | South American musical bows / chordophones | South American percussion instruments | The sounds of the Gran Chaco / Patagonia / Orinoco | Instruments and musical traditions of the Quechua / Aymara / Mapuche people.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2>
<hr />
<p>
Conferences are theoretical events similar in topics to educational concerts, although they substitute the exhibition and demonstration of instruments with the use of relevant audiovisual and multimedia materials. They address instruments as material documents and focus on the entanglement of sound, territory, and memory, including the ethical problems of representing and classifying musical cultures.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Examples (South America-focused):</i></b> Musical instruments (charangos and sirens, sikuri bands...) | Rhythms and musical styles (Colombian chirimía, Gaucho music...) | Traditional music (from the Guaraní, from the Sierra Nevada...) | Oral tradition and sound culture (in Patagonia, in the Andes...) | Dances and clothing (in the central Peruvian highlands, on the Argentine coast...) | Festivals and ceremonies (in the lowlands, in Titicaca...) | Customs, myths, and legends (Afro-Bolivians, in the lower Amazon...).</p>

<img src="../img/act03.png" alt="Activities. Courses and Workshops. By Edgardo Civallero" />
<hr />
<h2 id="courses">Courses and Workshops</h2>
<hr />
<p>
Courses and workshops are predominantly practical activities, covering the construction (only in some cases) and interpretation of traditional musical instruments from around the world. Beyond performance or organological description, they introduce documentation tools and critical methods for working with sound as heritage, archive, and living practice. They focus especially on aerophones and idiophones, and community musical groups, although they also address many other styles and instruments.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Examples (South America-focused):</i></b> Construction of simple instruments (sikus, quenas, bows) | Interpretation of solo instruments (quena, pinkillo, zampoña, rondador, tarka, mohoseño, bombo legüero, charango...) | Interpretation in traditional groups (sikuris, vertical flute troops, Argentine folk quartet, Colombian flutes...) | Interpretation of rhythms and styles (by regions, countries, ethnic groups, festivities...).</p>

<img src="../img/act04.png" alt="Activities. Seminars. By Edgardo Civallero" />
<hr />
<h2 id="seminars">Seminars</h2>
<hr />
<p>
Seminars are similar to courses and workshops but are predominantly theoretical and specialized in content. They emphasize documentary and archival approaches to musical instruments, with special attention to loss, preservation, and the politics of knowledge about sound.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Examples:</i></b> Musical instruments (by family, by region, by people) | Rhythms and musical styles (by country, by region, by people) | Traditional music (by country, by region, by people) | Oral tradition and sound culture | Dances (choreographies, styles) and clothing (by region) | Festivals, ceremonies, and festivals (by period, by people) | Customs, myths, and legends (by region, by people) | Collection of oral tradition (methodology and practice) | Management of oral and sound tradition (methodology and practice) | Methodology of musicological research | Field organology (methodology and practice).</p>
