<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
I am a musician, librarian, archivist, memory weaver, and craftsman. For almost three decades, I have worked with words, languages, sounds, silences, bodies, landscapes, and objects — especially those that resonate. In <i>Instrumentarium</i>, all these paths converge.</p>
<p>
<i>Instrumentarium</i>, inaugurated in March 2023, is a digital humanities project focused on research into musical instruments, especially traditional ones, and particularly those from Latin America. It is not a collection of instruments or a simple virtual archive. It is a space for action-research and critical reflection, where I experiment with ways of documenting, classifying, and narrating sound. Aerophones and chordophones coexist here with taxonomic schemes and podcasts, scores and canes — different forms of inquiry driven by the same impulse: to understand how sounds carry memory, how objects know, and how we might listen to and interpret them critically.</p>
<p>
The project seeks to generate organological knowledge through the analysis of documents from libraries, archives, museums, online repositories, and oral traditions, approached from the perspectives of knowledge and memory management disciplines (Library & Information Sciences, Archival Studies, and Museology). At the same time, <i>Instrumentarium</i> works directly with sound artifacts themselves, treating them as documents: objects capable of encoding, storing, and transmitting information across multiple dimensions — biological, geographical, social, economic, political, and cultural. This expanded notion of the document provides the conceptual bridge between organological analysis and broader questions of memory and knowledge.</p>
<p>
I work from the edges — from critical librarianship, insurgent epistemologies, rogue archival practice, and an unruly vision of organology and ethnomusicology. This position informs how I build taxonomies that do not quite fit, play instruments that are disappearing, create others that never existed, and imagine sonic landscapes and auditory cultures. It is also why I insist that a drum or a flute can be a document. This work takes place in Latin America, in the Colombian high Andean forest, in a workshop filled with seeds, scrap, vegetable fibers, plastic, and strings, where material making and informational thinking coexist — writing with clay and with data.</p>
<p>
<i>Instrumentarium</i> is not an academic project in the institutional sense, though it speaks with the academic world. It is not a catalog, though it classifies. It proposes a way of re-reading musical instruments, sonic documentation, and the knowledge technologies that are usually left out of view.</p>
<p>
This site — like the practice that sustains it — does not fully belong to any one discipline. And therein lies its strength.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>
The results of my processes of research, compilation, analysis and synthesis are expressed in a series of products, both academic and popular. The former are concentrated in the publication of <a href="articles.html" title="Articles">articles</a>, while the latter include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>A series of <a href="publications.html" title="Publications">publications</a> on musical instruments, written and illustrated by the author.

<li>A series of <a href="course.html" title="Open Course of Traditional Music">publications</a> mainly devoted to musicians and music teachers, distributed under the title <i>Open Course of Traditional Music</i>. They include didactic materials, both written and audiovisual, on traditional Latin American sounds, and methods of construction and interpretation of instruments. </li>
<li>A series of audio and video <a href="podcast.html" title="Sounds and silences">podcasts</a>, under the title <i>Sounds and silences</i>.</li>
<li>A series of <a href="activities.html" title="Activities">educational & artistic activities</a>, encompassed under the name <i>Sounds from a Land without Time</i>, which includes exhibitions, didactic concerts, conferences, courses, seminars and workshops related to the construction and execution of instruments, and to the documents, histories and stories that give an account of them in libraries, archives, museums, etc. </li>
<li>A series of <a href="projects.html" title="Projects">action-research projects</a>, especially on classification of musical instruments. </li>
<li>A series of <a href="recordings.html" title="Recordings">recordings</a>, that (will) range from traditional to modern Latin American music. </li>
<li>Activities of <a href="building.html" title="Instruments building">building</a> of musical instruments, including reproduction of originals, creation of novelties, use of recycled materials and use of natural elements. </li>
</ol></p>
<p>Additionally, <i>A Musician's Log</i>, the <a href="blog.html" title="A Musician's Log. Instrumentarium's blog">blog</a> of <i>Instrumentarium</i>, periodically presents informative content related to instruments, practices and musical expressions of the world.</p>
