<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
This site, inaugurated in March 2023, hosts or directs to the contents elaborated within the <i>Instrumentarium</i> project.</p>
<p>
<i>Instrumentarium</i> is a digital humanities framework and weaving of memories, focused on research about musical instruments, especially traditional ones, and particularly Latin American ones.</p>
<p>
The project is aimed at obtaining organological information through the analysis of documents from libraries, archives, museums, Internet and oral tradition repositories, from the perspective of the disciplines of knowledge and memory management (Library & Information Sciences, Archive Sciences, and Museology). In addition, it works with the sound artifacts themselves, considering them as "documents": elements capable of encoding, storing and transmitting information of all kinds (biological, geographical, social, economic, political...).</p>
<p>
The results of these processes of research, compilation, analysis and synthesis are expressed in a series of products, both academic and popular. The former are concentrated in the publication of <a href="articles.html" title="Articles">articles</a>, while the latter include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>A series of <a href="publications.html" title="Publications">publications</a> on musical instruments, written and illustrated by the author. They were originally published in digital format (in <a href="../libros.html" title="Libros">Spanish</a> e <a href="books.html" title="Books">English</a>) under the independent label <a href="https://www.edgardocivallero.com/eng/imprints.html" target="_blank" title="Wayrachaki Editora">Wayrachaki Editora</a> and, currently, they are edited under its successor El Zorro de Abajo Editora.</li>
<li>A series of <a href="class.html" title="Open Class of Traditional Music">publications</a> mainly devoted to musicians and music teachers, distributed under the title <i>Open Class of Traditional Music</i>. They include didactic materials, both written and audiovisual, on traditional Latin American sounds, and methods of construction and interpretation of instruments. </li>
<li>The digital magazine <i>Tierra de vientos</i>, devoted to disseminating Latin American sound cultures. </li>
<li>A series of audio and video <a href="podcast.html" title="Sounds and silences">podcasts</a>, under the title <i>Sounds and silences</i>.</li>
<li>A series of <a href="activities.html" title="Activities">educational & artistic activities</a>, encompassed under the name <i>Sounds from a Land without Time</i>, which includes exhibitions, didactic concerts, conferences, courses, seminars and workshops related to the construction and execution of instruments, and to the documents, histories and stories that give an account of them in libraries, archives, museums, etc. </li>
<li>A series of <a href="projects.html" title="Projects">action-research projects</a>, especially on classification of musical instruments. </li>
<li>A series of <a href="recordings.html" title="Recordings">recordings</a>, that (will) range from traditional to modern Latin American music. </li>
<li>Activities of <a href="building.html" title="Instruments building">building</a> of musical instruments, including reproduction of originals, creation of novelties, use of recycled materials and use of natural elements. </li>
</ol></p>
<p>Additionally, <i>A Musician's Log</i>, the <a href="blog.html" title="A Musician's Log. Instrumentarium's blog">blog</a> of <i>Instrumentarium</i>, periodically presents informative content related to instruments, practices and musical expressions of the world.</p>

<h2 id="author">The author</h2>
<p>
I am a multifaceted professional with 25 years of experience, born in the Puerto de Santa María of Buenos Aires (1973). I became a librarian in 1999 and earned my degree in Library and Information Science in 2004 from the National University of Córdoba (Argentina), where I also studied Biology and History (Anthropology and Archaeology). Earlier, I pursued Marine Sciences at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). After a long and varied career —including a specialization in Epistemologies of the South and a master's degree in Historical Archiving and Memory— I have been based since 2024 between Panama (where I direct the library of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) and Bogotá, Colombia, from where I work as a consultant on a wide range of knowledge and memory management projects and content production initiatives.</p>
<p>
I define myself as a <b>memory weaver</b>. I draw on extensive experience across traditional roles in information science and knowledge management, along with strong research skills, to trace the threads through which human knowledge and memory are constructed. To this I add a set of distinctive approaches —critical and social librarianship, "rogue" archival practice, decolonial perspectives, marginal viewpoints, activist and militant stances— and the integration of libraries, archives, and museums as interconnected spaces for generating knowledge and recovering hidden histories. I work with themes like natural sciences, traditional knowledge, cultural heritage, identity, and sound/silence — as a teacher, researcher, and writer.</p>
<p>
Through this plural and interdisciplinary lens, I combine content production, translation, graphic design, and editorial work to craft narratives that give meaning to what I do. I also deploy every available technology — from metadata, linked data, ontologies, semantic web tools, and classification systems, to digital asset management, preservation workflows, data curation, programming, AI, and IT solutions. Everything is useful for weaving memory. And in doing so, I emphasize the convergence of libraries, archives, and museums as unified knowledge and memory systems — just as human cultural heritage itself is.</p>
<p>
As a <b>semantic consultant</b>, I work at the points where institutional knowledge systems break down — or where they fail to convey what matters. My role is to intervene: not only by modeling ontologies or mapping metadata, but by helping scientific and memory-based institutions rethink the structures through which they organize, access, and share knowledge. I translate between disciplines, between technologies and lived experience, and between disconnected datasets — offering strategies that are technically sound, culturally grounded, and narratively aware.</p>
<p>
I understand and defend libraries as committed spaces of socio-political activism, cultural resistance, and collective identity.</p>
<p>
My work in the Galápagos Islands (2018-2023) linked me to fields like history and memory of science, open science, e-research, biodiversity conservation, citizen science, biomimicry, sustainability and degrowth, as well as knowledge mobilization, science communication, environmental education, and the preservation and digitization of heritage collections. It was at this intersection of biodiversity and memory that I began shaping my identity as a <b>biblio-naturalist</b>: exploring how libraries, archives, and knowledge spaces can be central to understanding and conserving biodiversity, supporting community resilience, and strengthening the connections between science, territory, and identity — a path I continue to deepen today across the tropical forests, mangroves, and coral coasts of Panama.</p>
<p>
Since 2004 I have been active in various IFLA sections and working groups, collaborated with the Universal Decimal Classification Consortium, participated in editorial boards and digital research spaces, taught courses and given lectures, and published essays and outreach materials through my independent <a href="https://edgardocivallero.com/eng/imprints.html" target="_blank" title="Imprints">imprints</a>: Wayrachaki Editora and El Zorro de Abajo Editora.</p>
<p>
Alongside my work as a librarian, I'm a musician — a multi-instrumentalist, competent in many instruments though master of none, focused on traditional Latin American and European music. I'm drawn to the world's sounds and silences, to the many stories they tell, and especially to the relationship between sound heritage, memory, and identity. I research and share findings through digital publications, compose and perform music, build instruments, explore new soundscapes, and develop personal research projects online.</p>
<p>
Beyond libraries and music, I'm also an editor, translator, and graphic designer; a former printing house worker; an avid language learner; a frustrated fiction writer; a blogger with two decades of experience; a Wikipedian and Esperantist; a citizen science apprentice; a sketch artist and photographer; and a puppet maker.</p>
