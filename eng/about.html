<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
<i>Instrumentarium</i> is an independent digital archive and research platform dedicated to the study and documentation of musical instruments, with an emphasis on traditional practices and Latin American sound worlds. Its central proposition is documentary: musical instruments can be treated as documents — not as texts, but as material entities that become intelligible and evidentiary through regimes of making, use, custody, description, and transmission. From that standpoint, organological analysis is not limited to morphology or acoustics; it also involves the ecological, social, political, and historical conditions through which sound artifacts acquire meaning and circulate as knowledge.</p>
<p>
The platform works in two complementary directions. First, it produces organological knowledge by analyzing documentary sources—collections, catalogs, repositories, and oral traditions — through the lenses of Library & Information Science, Archival Studies, and Museology. Second, it treats instruments and sound artifacts themselves as primary documents, using description, classification, and narrative to trace how materials, techniques, and practices carry memory. The work is published as blogs, articles, books, essays, field notes, bibliographies, audio pieces (including podcasts), scores, and experimental documentation formats.</p>
<p>
<i>Instrumentarium</i> does not function as a catalog or a private collection. It is a methodological workspace: a place to develop taxonomies, descriptive models, and forms of sonic documentation that conventional disciplinary boundaries often leave unaddressed. Its orientation is critical and constructivist: it treats knowledge infrastructures themselves — classification, metadata, archival description, and curatorial regimes — as technologies that shape what can be heard, remembered, and interpreted.</p>
<p>
The entire platform is sustained by <a href="civallero.html" title="Civallero">my practice</a> as a musician and as a professional in libraries and archives. The site is built from that intersection — where material making and informational thinking meet around objects that resonate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>
Outcomes</h2>
<p>
The results of the search, compilation, analysis, and synthesis processes that underpin <i>Instrumentarium</i> are published in two complementary registers. On the one hand, in academic forms — primarily articles and critical essays — where conceptual frameworks, methodological problems, and findings from organological and documentary research are presented. On the other hand, in dissemination and documentation forms that communicate, test, and expand the site’s models of description, classification, and narrative.</p>
<p><ul>
<li><a href="publications.html" title="Publications">Publications</a> (books, articles, and series): works written by the author on musical instruments.

<h2>
Lines of Work</h2>
<p>
The lines of work organize <i>Instrumentarium</i>’s long-term activities and remain in ongoing development. These are not “projects” as such, but rather sustained axes of research, documentation, artistic practice, and mediation, producing results in different formats (text, audio, scores, recordings, objects, and activities).</p>
<p><ul>
<li><a href="course.html" title="Open Course of Latin American Music"><i>Open Course of Latin American Music</i></a>: a series aimed at teachers and cultural mediators, with written and audio teaching materials on traditional Latin American music, and introductions to instrument construction and performance.</li>
<li><a href="podcast.html" title="Podcasts"><i>Sounds and Silences of the South</i></a>: a series of sound documentation in podcast format, focused on practices, objects, memories, and contexts of Latin American soundscapes.</li>
<li><a href="activities.html" title="Activities"><i>Sounds of a Land Without Time</i></a>: educational-artistic activities (exhibitions, annotated concerts, talks, courses, workshops) on instrument making/performance and their documentary trajectories in libraries, archives, museums, and repositories.</li>
<li><a href="recordings.html" title="Recordings">Music Production</a>: recordings and series that explore repertoires, techniques, and aesthetics, including specific lines such as <i>Little Sounds</i>.</li>
<li><a href="building.html" title="Building">Instrument Building</a>: reproduction of models, creation of variations, material experimentation (including recycling and use of natural elements), and documentation of processes.</li>
