<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
This site, inaugurated in March 2023, hosts or directs to the contents elaborated within the <i>Instrumentarium</i> project.</p>
<p>
<i>Instrumentarium</i> is a digital humanities framework and weaving of memories, focused on research about musical instruments, especially traditional ones, and particularly Latin American ones.</p>
<p>
The project is aimed at obtaining organological information through the analysis of documents from libraries, archives, museums, Internet and oral tradition repositories, from the perspective of the disciplines of knowledge and memory management (Library & Information Sciences, Archive Sciences, and Museology). In addition, it works with the sound artifacts themselves, considering them as "documents": elements capable of encoding, storing and transmitting information of all kinds (biological, geographical, social, economic, political...).</p>
<p>
The results of these processes of research, compilation, analysis and synthesis are expressed in a series of products, both academic and popular. The former are concentrated in the publication of <a href="articles.html" title="Articles">articles</a>, while the latter include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
